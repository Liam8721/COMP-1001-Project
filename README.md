# COMP-1001-Project
# Student Computer Systems
In this module I got to learn about computer architecture in a practical environment by programming in X86 intel assembly code . For the second part of this module I solved multiple questions consisting of mostly vectorisation. For these questions we had to program in C language, using intel intrinsics and despite not using C language before I recieved a score of 95% for the assembly code and 97% for the vectorisation project.
